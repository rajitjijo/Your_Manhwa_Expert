### Contains 2 repos inside

1. That will have a finetuned LLM using a LORA method, but creating the dataset has been a hassle so that will be paused for now.

2. The second one will use a vector dabase created using the books and use RAG to enhance the prompts <br>
    2.1 Ill try using only the first volume and see how that goes. Then eventually add more volumes. But im scared i dont have enough ram ðŸ˜£
